### Ingredients

*   Ribbed Celery 500 g
*   1 Eggplant
*   Sheep Ricotta (salted, Sicilian) 150 g
*   Fine Salt, to taste

_for the sauce_

*   Ribbed Tomatoes 1.5 kg
*   4 cloves of garlic
*   Fine Salt, to taste
*   1 bunch of basil

_for frying_

*   Extra Virgin Olive Oil, as needed

### Preparation

1.  To prepare Pasta alla Norma, first, wash and thoroughly dry the eggplant, then trim it. Slice it into approximately 8 mm thick rounds and place them in a colander. Sprinkle them with salt and let them drain for at least 15 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, attend to the tomatoes: wash them, removing the stems. Cut them in half. Transfer the tomatoes to a saucepan with a pinch of salt, 3 cloves of garlic (you can reduce if preferred, but it characterizes Pasta alla Norma), and a bunch of basil. Let them cook for 30 minutes over low heat without adding anything; the tomatoes will release their juices. After 30 minutes, remove garlic and basil. Transfer the tomatoes to a fine-mesh sieve and strain.
3.  Once you have obtained your tomato puree, transfer it to a pan, add another clove of garlic and a sprig of basil. Let it cook for another 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4.  You can rinse the eggplants well, pat them dry with kitchen paper. Then, pour extra virgin olive oil into a high-sided pot and heat it to a temperature of about 170-180Â°C. Immerse a few eggplants at a time in the oil, turning them occasionally. It will take a few minutes for them to become golden brown. Drain them with tongs and transfer them to a tray lined with kitchen paper. Continue frying the eggplants and meanwhile, put a pot of water on the stove for boiling the pasta. When the sauce is quite thick, remove the basil, add a tablespoon of the frying oil from the eggplants and a drizzle of raw oil.
5.  Cook the pasta al dente, drain it, and transfer it to the sauce. Toss quickly to coat.
6.  Plate the pasta, add the fried eggplants, plenty of grated salted sheep's ricotta, a basil leaf, and serve your Pasta alla Norma!
